# Review of your R Code Assignment
## by Jazelli Mueterthies

Well, firstly, it ran all the way through without breaking so that's a good start.

Not really a 'must do' but more just a suggestion: your big code for data processing should maybe be divided into multiple smaller blocks of code, so if something did go wrong it would be easy to find and easy to move on from that point. That's more of a preference thing on my part,  though.

Some of the things you did could have been consolidated into a loop but it works just fine as is too.


The Data Inspection part still looks like it needs to be done.

Your graphs worked and turned out well, too so that's great.


Not much feedback left to give. All suggestions I could make just come down to preference, since your code works completely as far as I can tell. :)
